# 00/27-custom-drag-and-drop

This project is all about building a drag and drop solution from the ground up, without relying on any dependencies.

I will use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (obviously) with [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/), and will add one dependency [auto-animate by formkit](https://auto-animate.formkit.com/) for nicer animation (because sometimes working with custom animation is a headache, and in this case it sure is)
